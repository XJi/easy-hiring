A mobile application provides services for both job hunters and recuiters on career fairs! 

The application is built via React Native and Firebase. We recommend Expo for viewing the demo as this app is initialized via create-react-native. As for the deployment, we have tested on both android and iOS devices. 

### prerequisite libraries/packages checklist 
 react-native-firebase
 react-native-canvas
 react-navigation
 react-native-elements
 react-native-qrcode
 
### run application
Assume the updated version NodeJS has been installed, to set up this app properly, first install create-react-native to anable bootstrapping:

`npm install -g create-react-native-app` 


Install missing packages accordingly and ensure you have packages mentioned in checklist under your node_modules folder. 


Time to check it out(inside easyHiring folder):
